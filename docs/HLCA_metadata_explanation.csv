Metadata category:,Explanation:
3'_or_5',Whether 3' or 5' sequencing was performed.
age,"Age of subject. Wherever an age range was provided, the mean of the range is shown."
anatomical_region_ccf_score,"Anatomical location from which the sample was taken, encoded into a 1-dimension common coordinate framework (ccf) score. 0 represents the most proximal location (nose, inferior turbinate), whereas 1 represents the most distal location (parenchyma). For more information, see HLCA paper."
anatomical_region_level_[1-3],"Anatomical location from which the sample was taken, broken down into levels (1 coarsest, 3 finest). Wherever finer region of sample was not known, the coarser level is specified, with a prefix of the level (e.g. when level 2 not known, ""Parenchyma"" from level 1 is forward-propagated as ""1_Parenchyma) in level 2)."
anatomical_region_highest_res,"Highest level at which ""anatomical_region_level_[1-3]"" is known."
ann_coarse_for_GWAS_and_modeling,"Final annotations by the HLCA expert team, at the level that was used for GWAS and covariate modeling analysis (see paper for more info). These are often not the finest levels of annotation available."
ann_finest_level,"Final annotations by the HLCA expert team, shown at the finest level of detail available for every cell."
ann_highest_res,"Matching level number for ""ann_finest_level"""
ann_level_[1-5],"Final annotations by the HLCA expert team, broken down into levels (1 coarsest, 5 finest). Where annotations do not go up to level 5, levels without annotations are set to None. "
BMI,"BMI of the subject, when available"
cell_ranger_version,CellRanger version used to process sequencing data. 
condition,"Lung condition of donor. Note that for cancer patients, non-tumorous tissue was used for the samples in the HLCA core. Cells set to ""nan"" come from donors without lung condition."
dataset,"Dataset. This was the variable used for the integration of datasets. Often corresponds to ""study"", although some studies were split into multiple datasets, e.g. based on sequencing platform. See the HLCA paper for more information on dataset definition."
entropy_[cat]_leiden_3,"Entropy of category (e.g. subject_ID, dataset) among cells, at level 3 leiden clusters. This score quantifies the diversity in terms of a category among the cells of a cluster."
ethnicity,Ethnicity of subject from which sample was taken.
fresh_or_frozen,Whether cells come from a fresh or frozen sample.
last_author_PI,"Last author(s) of study, or PI(s) leading the project for unpublished datasets."
leiden_[1-5],"Clustering, broken down into levels (1 coarsest, 5 finest). Nested clustering was performed, with parent clusters specified in cluster names."
log10_total_counts,Log10 of total number of UMIs detected in the cell.
mito_frac,Fraction of counts (UMIs) from mitochondrial RNA. 
mixed_ethnicity,Ethnicities of subject if ethnicity did not fit into a single category.
n_genes,Number of genes with at least 1 count in the cell.
original_ann_level_[1-5],"Original cell type labels, as provided by datasets generators broken down into levels (1 coarsest, 5 finest). To resolve differences in nomenclature and level of annotation detail, these annotations are harmonized based on a mapping of provided labels to a hierarchical common label reference. Where annotations do not go up to level 5, levels without annotations are set to None. Note that a full re-annotation was performed after integration by a HLCA expert team. These annotations can be found under ""ann_level_[1-5]""."
reannotation_type,"Comparison of ""original_ann_level_[1-5]"" to ""ann_level_[1-5]"". If original and final annotations are contradictory, cells are labeled as ""misannotated"", or ""underannotated, incorrect"". Where original labels were correct, but less detailed than final annotations, cells are labeled as ""underannotated, correct"". Where annotations match both in label and level of annotation, cells are labeled as ""correctly annotated"". "
ribo_frac,Fraction of counts (UMIs) from ribosomal RNA. 
sample,Sample from wich cells came.
sample_type,"Type of sample (e.g. brush, biopsy, surgical resection)."
scanvi_label,"Cell type labels that were used for the integration of datasets. Correspond to level 1, 2 or 3 of ""original_ann_level_[1-5]""."
sequencing_platform,Platform used for sequencing.
sex,Sex of subject from which cells came.
single_cell_platform,Single cell platform used.
size_factors,Normalization factors used to normalize raw count data.
smoking_status,"Smoking status of subject (grouped into ""ever"", ""former"" or ""never"" smoker)."
study,"Original study from which data came, named by last author(s)/PIs and year of publication/dataset generation."
study_long,"Same as study, but now named as [institute]_[last_author(s)/PI(s)]_[year_of_publication/data_generation]_[first_author/unpublished]"
subject_ID,ID of subject/donor from which sample was taken.
subject_type,"Type of subject from which sample was taken, i.e. whether they were an organ donor, alive, and healthy or diseased."
Standardized metadata categories (only on cellxgene version of HLCA):,
assay,Same as single_cell_platform
cell_type,"Cell type annotation, harmonized with Uberon cell ontology. This often contains coarser annotations than our actual annotations, so not recommended to use unless you need cell ontology annotations."
developmental stage,Same as age
ethnicity,"Same as ethnicity above, but mapped to standardized human ancestry ontology (""hancestro"")"
tissue,"Same as anatomical_region_level_1, but mapped to Uberon tissue ontology"
